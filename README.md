# makesite

This repository holds a simple web project scaffolded with Vite and TypeScript. This is just so I can learn concepts about web frameworks.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The entry point of the web application.
- `src/main.ts`: The main TypeScript file that initializes the application and where you can write components.
- `src/component.ts`: A TypeScript class representing a generic component for the application.
- `src/style.css`: The main stylesheet for the application that imports Bulma.

## Features

- **Vite and TypeScript Integration**: Utilizes Vite for fast development server start and HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and TypeScript for type-safe code.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Demonstrates a simple way to create and manage web components using pure TypeScript.

## Need to work on

- **Event Handlers**: Incorporate event handlers to add interactivity to the web components.
- **State Management**: Introduce state management concepts to handle application state changes effectively.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brandon-carlisle/makesite.git
